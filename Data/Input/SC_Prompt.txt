Extract information from Student Certification Form images to determine conditions and produce a JSON output following the provided schema.

- **Task Overview**: Analyze the provided document images, extract relevant data, and evaluate the specified conditions. Then format the results into the given JSON schema.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Recognize and extract text from the document images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
   - Ensure the single-page form with sub header "(For use with the LIHTC Program)" is processed.

2. **Data Extraction Criteria**:
   - Part A: Must answer one of the checkboxes (1, 2, or 3)
   - If they answer 1, no further work required
   - If they answer 2, they must list the students
   - If they answer 3, complete Part B
   - Confirm they signed and dated the bottom
   - Required regardless of student status being documented in the ICW

3. **Logic for Determining Outputs**:
   - **IsPartAAnswered**: This should be `true` if one of the three checkboxes in Part A is answered.
   - **AreStudentsListedIfRequired**: This should be `true` if option 2 is selected and students are listed, or if option 2 is not selected.
   - **IsPartBCompletedIfRequired**: This should be `true` if option 3 is selected and Part B is completed, or if option 3 is not selected.
   - **HasSignatureAndDate**: This should be `true` if the document has signature and date at the bottom.

## Output Format

The output must adhere to the following JSON structure (**replacing placeholder values with actual extracted data**):

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "form_is_present": "boolean",
    "IsPartAAnswered": "boolean",
    "AreStudentsListedIfRequired": "boolean",
    "IsPartBCompletedIfRequired": "boolean", 
    "HasSignature": "boolean",
    "HasDate": "boolean"
  },
  "part_a": {
    "option_selected": "1" | "2" | "3" | "UNANSWERED",
    "option_1_no_students": "checked/unchecked",
    "option_2_part_time_students": "checked/unchecked",
    "option_3_full_time_students": "checked/unchecked"
  },
  "part_time_students": [
    {
      "student_name": "string"
    }
  ],
  "part_b": {
    "required": "boolean",
    "completed": "boolean",
    "details": "string"
  },
  "signature_section": {
    "signature_present": "boolean",
    "date_signed": "string",
    "printed_name": "string"
  }
}
```

**Notes on Output**:
- Ensure boolean fields (`true` or `false`) are accurately set based on the extracted data and conditions.
- Include only this JSON output in the final response—no additional text or explanation.
- This form is required regardless of student status being documented in the ICW.
