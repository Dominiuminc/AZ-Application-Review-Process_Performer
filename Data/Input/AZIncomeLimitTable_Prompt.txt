Extract information from AZ Income Limit Table images to determine conditions and produce a JSON output following the provided schema.

- **Task Overview**: Analyze the provided document images, extract relevant data, and evaluate the specified conditions. Then format the results into the given JSON schema.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Recognize and extract text from the document images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
   - Identify the landscape document format, typically rotated 90 degrees.

2. **Data Extraction Criteria**:
   - Confirm document is titled "Arizona Income Housing TAX Credit Program - Imputed Incomes/Allowable Rents"
   - Verify document is from AZ Housing Authority
   - Check that document is in landscape format
   - Ensure document is present and readable

3. **Logic for Determining Outputs**:
   - **HasCorrectTitle**: This should be `true` if the document title matches "Arizona Income Housing TAX Credit Program - Imputed Incomes/Allowable Rents".
   - **IsFromAZHousing**: This should be `true` if the document indicates it's from AZ Housing Authority.
   - **IsLandscapeFormat**: This should be `true` if the document appears to be in landscape orientation.
   - **IsDocumentReadable**: This should be `true` if the document is clear and legible.

## Output Format

The output must adhere to the following JSON structure (**replacing placeholder values with actual extracted data**):

```json
{
  "HasCorrectTitle": true,
  "IsFromAZHousing": true,
  "IsLandscapeFormat": false,
  "IsDocumentReadable": true
}
```

**Notes on Output**:
- Ensure boolean fields (`true` or `false`) are accurately set based on the extracted data and conditions.
- Include only this JSON output in the final response—no additional text or explanation.
- This document needs to be included in the packet but no business rule verification is required.
