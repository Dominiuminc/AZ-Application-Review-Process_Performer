Extract information from Affidavit of Student Financial Assistance images to determine conditions and produce a JSON output following the provided schema.

- **Task Overview**: Analyze the provided document images, extract relevant data, and evaluate the specified conditions. Then format the results into the given JSON schema.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Recognize and extract text from the document images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
   - Ensure all relevant sections of the worksheet are processed, such as FIXME

2. **Data Extraction Criteria**:
   - Part 1-3: Confirm checked yes/no for every field.
   - Part 1-3: If they check yes for any, there should be an amount listed, and a total summed up at the bottom.
   - Part 4: Confirm all fields should be answered even if the answer is N/A or None.
   - Confirm signature and date at the bottom
   - Must have verification from school of financial aid.FIXME- there's another document that needs to be included in case the student's affidavit


3. **Logic for Determining Outputs**:
   - **AreAllFieldsChecked**: This should be `true` if every field in parts 1-3 is checked yes or no.
   - **DoAllYesFieldsHaveAnAmount**: This should be `true` if all yes fields have an amount marked after them.
   - **AreAmountsTotaled**: This should be `true` if total amounts are totaled below or no amount exist.
   - **AreAllPartFourFieldsAnswered**: This should be `true` if all part four fields are answered even if the answer is N/A or None.
   - **HasSignatureAndHasDate**: This should be `true` if the document has signature and has date.
