Extract information from Member Information Document Form images to determine conditions and produce a JSON output following the provided schema.

- **Task Overview**: Analyze the provided document images, extract relevant data, and evaluate the specified conditions. Then format the results into the given JSON schema.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Recognize and extract text from the document images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).
   - Ensure all relevant sections of the single-page form are processed.

2. **Data Extraction Criteria**:
   - Confirm the first section of legal name, DOB, Gender, and SSN all have been documented
   - Part A: Must answer one of the student options
   - Part B: Must complete this if they are under 18 and not emancipated
   - Confirm all documents are signed and dated
   - One form required for each household member

3. **Logic for Determining Outputs**:
   - **AreBasicFieldsCompleted**: This should be `true` if legal name, DOB, Gender, and SSN are all documented.
   - **IsPartAAnswered**: This should be `true` if one of the student options in Part A is answered.
   - **IsPartBCompletedIfRequired**: This should be `true` if Part B is completed when required (under 18 and not emancipated) or not required.
   - **HasSignatureAndDate**: This should be `true` if the document has signature and date.

## Output Format

The output must adhere to the following JSON structure (**replacing placeholder values with actual extracted data**):

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "AreBasicFieldsCompleted": "boolean",
    "IsPartAAnswered": "boolean", 
    "IsPartBCompletedIfRequired": "boolean",
    "HasSignature": "boolean",
    "HasDate": "boolean"
  },
  "member_info": {
    "legal_name": "string",
    "date_of_birth": "string",
    "gender": "string", 
    "social_security_number": "string"
  },
  "part_a_student_status": {
    "full_time_student": "checked/unchecked",
    "part_time_student": "checked/unchecked",
    "not_student": "checked/unchecked"
  },
  "part_b_minor_info": {
    "required": "boolean",
    "completed": "boolean",
    "details": "string"
  },
  "signature_section": {
    "signature_present": "boolean",
    "date_signed": "string"
  }
}
```

**Notes on Output**:
- Ensure boolean fields (`true` or `false`) are accurately set based on the extracted data and conditions.
- Include only this JSON output in the final response—no additional text or explanation.
- Remember that one form is required for each household member.
