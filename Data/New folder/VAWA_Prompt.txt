Extract information from VAWA Acknowledgement of Receipt images to determine conditions and produce a JSON output following the provided schema.

- **Task Overview**: Analyze the provided document images, extract relevant data, and evaluate the specified conditions. Then format the results into the given JSON schema.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Recognize and extract text from the document images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

2. **Data Extraction Criteria**:
   - Page contains a table with 9 possible Applicant/Resident Signatures

3. **Logic for Determining Outputs**:
   - **HasVAWATitle**: This should be `true` if the page is titled "VAWA Acknowledgement of Receipt".
   - **HasSignatureTable**: This should be `true` if the page contains a table with 9 possible Applicant/Resident Signatures.
   - **HasAtLeastOneSignature**: This should be `true` if the document has at least one complete signature
   - **Signatures**: This should contain a list of all signed lines of the table
     - **HasSignature**: True if that line has a signature
     - **PrintedName**: The name printed on that line
     - **Date**: The date printed on that line

## Output Format

The output must adhere to the following JSON schema:

```json
{
  "validation": {
    "form_is_present": "boolean",
    "has_signature": "boolean", 
    "has_date": "boolean"
  },
  "HasAtLeastOneSignature": "boolean",
  "Signatures": [
    {
      "HasSignature": "boolean",
      "PrintedName": "string",
      "Date": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Notes on Output**:
- Ensure boolean fields (`true` or `false`) are accurately set based on the extracted data and conditions.
- Include only this JSON output in the final response—no additional text or explanation.
