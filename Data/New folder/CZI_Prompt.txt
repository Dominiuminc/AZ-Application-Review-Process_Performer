Extract information from Certification of Zero Income Form images to determine conditions and produce a JSON output following the provided schema.

- **Task Overview**: Analyze the provided document images, extract relevant data, and evaluate the specified conditions. Then format the results into the given JSON schema.

## Steps to Complete the Task

1. **Image Processing**:
   - Recognize and extract text from the document images using OCR (Optical Character Recognition).

2. **Data Extraction Criteria**:
   - Confirm all 16 questions in section A are answered
   - Confirm all questions in section B are completed
   - Rent, Utilities, and Food must have an amount and who is paying answered
   - The rest can check N/A box if needed
   - Confirm signature and date at the bottom

3. **Logic for Determining Outputs**:
   - **AreAll16QuestionsAnswered**: This should be `true` if all 16 questions in section A are answered.
   - **AreSectionBQuestionsCompleted**: This should be `true` if all questions in section B are completed.
   - **AreRentUtilitiesFoodCompleted**: This should be `true` if Rent, Utilities, and Food have amounts and who is paying is answered.
   - **HasSignatureAndDate**: This should be `true` if the document has signature and date at the bottom.

## Output Format
